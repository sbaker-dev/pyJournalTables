        Table length is not base zero, hence why we need to take one way from it
        negative skip indexes are formatted in the same way as indexing, so -1 retrieves the last element. However, if
            we take the index of -1 from the table length then we always skip the second to last element. We can't use
            zero, as zero is an actual index for the first element. As such, each negative value gets +1 added to it.
